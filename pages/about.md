# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am currently studying Media Computer Science at the Technical University Dresden (TUD) and looking for hands on experience in the industry (internship of 6 months). Through various university projects Iâ€™ve learned the basics about UI and UX Design but would love to have a deeper understanding of work flows and how to improve my designs. I have always admired a great functioning user experience and want to create designs that help people and that they love to use. I cannot wait to work on valuable and real projects :)
