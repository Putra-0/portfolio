# **About Me**

Hi I am **Nga** :wave:,<br> <!-- **{{ site.author.name }}** -->
I’m currently studying Media Computer Science at Technical University Dresden and looking for hands on experience in the industry (paid internship of 6 months). <br>
Through various university projects I’ve learned the basics of media design including UI and UX design but would love to get a deeper understanding of work flows and how to improve my designs. <br>
I have always admired a great functioning user experience and want to create designs that help people and that they love to use. I cannot wait to work on valuable and real projects :)
